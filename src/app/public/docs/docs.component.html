<h3>Response</h3>

<app-code-snippet [contents]="responseExample"></app-code-snippet>

<h4>Fields</h4>

<ul class="limited-width">
  <li>
    <span class="code">results</span>: If the request was successful, contains a list of dictionaries with the keys
    <span class="code">"ingredientRaw"</span>, <span class="code">"ingredientParsed"</span>, and
    <span class="code">"error"</span>.
    <ul>
    <li>
      <span class="code">ingredientRaw</span>: The original user-supplied ingredient string that corresponds with this parse
      result.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="code">ingredientParsed</span>: A dictionary containing the ingredient as structured data, containing the
      keys <span class="code">"quantity"</span>, <span class="code">"unit"</span>, <span class="code">"product"</span>,
      and <span class="code">"preparationNotes"</span>.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="code">quantity</span>: A number representing the quantity represented in the ingredient string,
          or <span class="code">null</span> if no quantity was detected in the ingredient string.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="code">unit</span>: A string containing the unit of measure in the ingredient string, or
          <span class="code">null</span> if no unit of measure was found.
          <ul>
            <li>The unit of measure is always in singular form (e.g., <span class="code">"teaspoon"</span>, not
              <span class="code">"teaspoons"</span>).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="code">product</span>: The product a user buys to obtain this ingredient (e.g.,
            <span class="code">"ground beef"</span>, <span class="code">"brown sugar"</span>).
          <ul>
            <li>
              Size qualifications (e.g., <span class="code">"large onion"</span>, <span class="code">jumbo shrimp</span>) are
              treated as part of a product's name.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="code">preparationNotes</span>: Instructions to the user about how to prepare this ingredient for a recipe (e.g.,
            <span class="code">"finely chopped"</span>, <span class="code">"halved"</span>).
          <ul>
            <li>
              Preparation notes refer to actions that a user takes after purchasing an ingredient. In some cases, such as "ground cinnamon"
              this is ambiguous because a user can purchase whole cinnamon sticks and grind them (which would treat grinding as a preparation
              step) or a user can purchase the product "ground cinnamon" (which has no preparation steps).
            </li>
            <li>
              For ambiguous cases, the parser attempts to choose the product that is more common. For example, "ground cinnamon"
              is treated as a product name because most users purchase cinnamon pre-ground. In contrast, "diced celery" is interpreted as
              <span class="code">product="celery"</span>, <span class="code">preparationNotes="diced"</span> because users more
              commonly dice celery instead of buying pre-diced celery.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="code">error</span>: An error message that describes what caused <span class="code">ingredientRaw</span>
      to fail parsing.
    </li>
    </ul>  
  </li>
  <li><span class="code">error</span>: An error message that describes what caused the full parse request to fail.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Known Limitations</h2>
